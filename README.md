================================

This includes a few Jupyter Python Notebooks I use as examples in my teaching.

## Hosted Quickstart

For quickly testing this out, we recommend launching this repo directly in Binder. Click this button to build and launch

## Run on Your Own Machine.

If you want to use these on your local machine:

1. Install Python 3.x
2. Setup Jupyter Notebooks (if you are new try [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) with [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html))
3. [Sign up for a Media Cloud account](https://tools.mediacloud.org/#/user/signup) to obtain an API key.

These use a few super-handy libraries.  To install do `pip install -r requirements.pip`.
